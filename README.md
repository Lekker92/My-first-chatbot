# Chatbot Project

## Domain

The chatbot serves three purposes:
1. Virtual Travel Agent
2. Restaurant Reservation System
3. Customer Support Bot

### Motivation

Those three domains were chosen to demonstrate the chatbot's versatility in handling various scenarios such as booking tickets, recommending menu items, and troubleshooting products.

## Implemented Scenarios

1. **Virtual Travel Agent: Booking a ticket**
2. **Restaurant Reservation System: Asking for menu recommendations**
3. **Customer Support Bot: Providing troubleshooting help**

## Future Capabilities

By the end of the class, the chatbot should be capable of:
- Handling more complex conversations and contextual queries
- Providing more personalized responses based on user preferences
- Providing a variety of responses on all domains.
